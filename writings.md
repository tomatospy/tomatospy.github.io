## Shorter pieces

Various opinion pieces or short chapters I've written.

##### [China's cyber espionage surge in Australia: opportunism not punishment](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/chinas-cyber-espionage-surge-in-australia-opportunism-not-punishment/)

It's often thought that states use cyber operations to punish each other, but I think that is unlikely, or at least misguided. In the aftermath of the Prime Ministers announcement that Australia was being targeted by a sophisticated state-based actor I [wrote about](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/chinas-cyber-espionage-surge-in-australia-opportunism-not-punishment/) the reasons why we might be being targeted.

## Book reviews

I quite enjoy doing book reviews—they force me to engage with the book in a far deeper way than I would just reading it.

##### [*The System: Who owns the internet, and how it owns us*](https://www.defence.gov.au/adc/Publications/AJDSS/volume2-number1/review3-the-system-james-ball.asp) by [James Ball](https://twitter.com/jamesrbuk)

This was an interesting book but I didn't agree entirely with Ball's thesis. I [wrote](https://www.defence.gov.au/adc/Publications/AJDSS/volume2-number1/review3-the-system-james-ball.asp):

> At its best the book educates and entertains with illuminating, well told stories about poorly understood corners of the internet: how it was created; how it is run; how new companies are financed through venture capital; and its darker aspects like user tracking and the world of targeted advertising. These stories lay bare the underlying incentives that exist online and shape behaviour. But ultimately, this book fails to weave Ball's many varied strands together into an entirely compelling argument.



##### [*The Hacker and the State*](https://insidestory.org.au/war-by-other-means/) by [Ben Buchanan](https://twitter.com/buchananben)

This was a good book and I think worth reading if you are interested in the geopolitical import of cyber operations and how they are used. From [my review](https://insidestory.org.au/war-by-other-means/):

> In a nutshell, Buchanan’s argument is that cyber operations are good for shaping but not for signalling. In high-stakes international statecraft, cyber capabilities are a versatile way of changing the facts on the ground, altering the balance of power, and seizing the advantage. Like all covert operations, though, they aren’t good for signalling intentions. Even when the effects of a cyber operation are visible, victims are often reluctant to reveal details publicly, and the expertise and time needed to determine who did what makes it difficult to quickly and reliably judge what has happened, who was to blame, and why they did it.



## Publications

Here are the longer publications and reports that I've authored or co-authored.

##### [Clean Pipes: Should ISPs provide a more secure internet?](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/clean-pipes-should-isps-provide-more-secure-internet)

I [examined](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/clean-pipes-should-isps-provide-more-secure-internet) the rationale for ISPs to do more to protect their customers from dangers online.

##### [Retweeting through the Firewall](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/retweeting-through-great-firewall)

The [sequel report](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/retweeting-through-great-firewall) about continuing PRC activity on both Twitter and Facebook, continuing on from what we saw previously in Tweeting through the Firewall. 

—*12 June 2020*


##### [Hacking for ca$h](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/hacking-cash)

[This report](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/hacking-cash) examined whether the PRC was abiding by the various high-level agreements it had made to stop cyber espionage for commercial gain.

—*25 September 2018*

**Spoiler alert**: at the time this report came out it was still possible that they were... although now it is clear that they haven't.

##### [Tweeting through the Firewall](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/tweeting-through-great-firewall)

Twitter released a data set of accounts and tweets that it had determined where involved in a state sponsored information operation targeting the Hong Kong anti-extradition law protests. A team of us [analysed](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/tweeting-through-great-firewall) this data set.

##### [Defining Offensive Cyber Capabilities](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/defining-offensive-cyber-capabilities)

[Here](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/defining-offensive-cyber-capabilities) I define offensive cyber capabilites as: *using operations to manipulate, deny, disrupt, degrade, or destroy targeted computers, information systems or networks*, and then discuss various options for control. 

—*4 July 2018*

**Spoiler alert**: 'cyber weapons' are not a thing and options for control mostly involve making cyber operations more expensive and encouraging responsible use. I'm also skeptical about 'cyber norms', mostly because too many people talk about them as if they will restrain state actions all by themselves.

##### [The Internet of Insecure Things](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/InternetOfInsecureThings)

[This paper](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/InternetOfInsecureThings) looks at the security issues surrounding what are known as Internet of Things devices, small, often consumer-grade internet-connected devices that typically have very poor levels of security.

##### [Cyber Maturity in the Asia Pacific Region 2017](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/cyber-maturity-asia-pacific-region-2017)

A [round-up](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/cyber-maturity-asia-pacific-region-2017) of the 'cyber maturity' of 25 countries Asia-Pacific countries, where maturity was measured by taking account of a range of governance, legal and societal metrics.
