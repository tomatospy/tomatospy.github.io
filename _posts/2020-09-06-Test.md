This is a list of the publications I've authored and co-authored.

#### [Tweeting through the Firewall](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/tweeting-through-great-firewall)

Twitter released a data set of accounts and tweets that it had determined where involved in a state sponsored information operation targeting the Hong Kong anti-extradition law protests. A team of us [analysed](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/tweeting-through-great-firewall) this data set. *3 September 2019*


#### [Defining Offensive Cyber Capabilities](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/defining-offensive-cyber-capabilities)

[Here](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/defining-offensive-cyber-capabilities) I define offensive cyber capabilites as: *using operations to manipulate, deny, disrupt, degrade, or destroy targeted computers, information systems or networks*, and then discuss various options for control. *4 July 2018*

**Spoiler alert**: 'cyber weapons' are not a thing and options for control mostly involve making cyber operations more expensive and encouraging responsible use. I'm also skeptical about 'cyber norms', mostly because too many people talk about them as if they will restrain state actions all by themselves.

#### [The Internet of Insecure Things](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/InternetOfInsecureThings)

[This paper](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/InternetOfInsecureThings) looks at the security issues surrounding what are known as Internet of Things devices, small, often consumer-grade internet-connected devices that typically have very poor levels of security. *19 March 2018*
#### [Cyber Maturity in the Asia Pacific Region 2017](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/cyber-maturity-asia-pacific-region-2017)

A [round-up](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/cyber-maturity-asia-pacific-region-2017) of the 'cyber maturity' of 25 countries Asia-Pacific countries, where maturity was measured by taking account of a range of governance, legal and societal metrics.
